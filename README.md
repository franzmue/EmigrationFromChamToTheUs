# Emigration from Cham to the US

## The diagram

The diagram in *png* format shows a *choropleth map*.
The map contains the borders of the US states and counties.
The darker the (blue) areas within the counties borders the higher is the probability that there are people living there, having ancestors originating from the *Cham* district (in Bavaria/Germany, close to the Czech border).

## The results

* *Wisconsin* has the highest probability.
* The next US states in the ranking are *Pennsylvania*, *Iowa*, *Minnesota*, *California*, *New York*, *Colorado*.
* Highest probabilities in *Wisconsin*:
  * Counties: Milwaukee, Winnebago, Outagamie, Portage, Dane  
  * Cities: Milwaukee, Madison, Oshkosh, and Menasha
* Highest probabilities in *Pennsylvania*:
  * Counties: Allegheny, Philadelphia, Washington
  * Cities: Pittsburgh, Philadelphia
* Highest probabilities in *Iowa*:
  * Counties: Polk, Johnson, Linn, Benton
  * Cities: Des Moines, Iowa City
* Highest probabilities in *Minnesota*:
  * Counties: Hennepin, Dakota
  * Cities: Minneapolis
* Highest probabilities in *California*:
  * Counties: Orange, Los Angeles
  * Cities: Azusa
* Highest probabilities in *New York*:
  * Counties: Erie
  * Cities: Buffalo, Erie
* Highest probabilities in *Colorado*:
  * Counties: Boulder, Arapahoe, Paso
  * Cities: Boulder, Littleton

## The line of reasoning

My approach was not a scientific one. I just tried to use common sense and some basic statistic knowledge.

* Concentrating on regionally characteristic family names in the *Cham* district.
* Considering only family names which also often ocurred in the 19th century (because this period was an important period in my own genealogy research).
* Include different spellings of the family names in the US.
* Omit the family names which only occur rarely in the US.
* Comparing family name frequencies at a comparable regional level. Here *Cham* is compared to US Counties.
* Determine the frequencies of the family names in the US counties.
* Higher family name frequencies and a high number of different ocurring family names in a county should indicate higher probabilities that people living there have roots in the *Cham* district in Bavaria, Germany.

## Background

### Finding German ancestors

Finding people in foreign countries having the same roots often is a tedious and even impossible task. Quite often it is unclear from what place in the foreign country the ancestors started their journey. In Germany there is no central database where the search can be started. Without the place it's difficult to start the research.

### Emigration patterns

In my investigation I tried to show that people were not emigrating randomly to their destinations. There were migration patterns and some areas are related closer than others. The approach does not lead to a single place where the search can be started successfully, but the approach might at least help to focus on a smaller area to start the search.

### Family names and places

When I started spending some spare time on genealogy, I pretty soon was sure that there is more information in telephone books than simply names and addresses. It was obvious to me that there is still some historical migration information in it - although it's not obvious.

In 2004 I made my first manual approach to extract some of this hidden information. I even ignored most of the address data in the telephone directories and concentrated on surname-place-pairs.

I am quite sure the approach could be generalized and automated.

## References

The map was created with [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/).
Apart from my own results I relied on the [Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles for US Counties (2013)](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_counties.html) of the *US Census Bureau*.

From telephone directories (*DeTeMedien* in Germany and *whitepages.com* in the US) I took pairs of surnames and the corresponding places where they lived.
